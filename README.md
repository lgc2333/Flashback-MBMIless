Flashback is a Minecraft mod which allows you to record your Minecraft gameplay, play it back and create stunning cinematic shots.

This fork intentionally excludes MixinBiomeModificationImpl to make this mod work with Sinytra Connector again since 0.13.0 (commit 67aa3c1):
https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues/1678

## How to install
1. Install NeoForge (https://neoforged.net/)
2. Dowload Sinytra Connector (https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) & Forgified Fabric API (https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api)
3. Put each mod's JAR into your mods folder (.minecraft/mods)
4. Run the game

## Support

As this is not an intended way to run Flashback so **expect no support, I'm also not a coder and this solution just happened to work for me.**
