**This is a fork of the original Flashback mod.**

Flashback is a Minecraft mod which allows you to record your Minecraft gameplay, play it back and create stunning cinematic shots.

This fork intentionally excludes MixinBiomeModificationImpl to make this mod work with Sinytra Connector again since 0.13.0 (commit 67aa3c1):
https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues/1678

**Expect no support, I'm not a coder and just found this to work.**

## How to install
1. Install NeoForge (https://neoforged.net/)
2. Dowload Sinytra Connector (https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) and Forgified Fabric API (https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api)
3. Put each mod's JAR into your mods folder (.minecraft/mods)
4. Run the game
